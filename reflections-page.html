          <p>Upon creating this website, the use of user profiles offer considerably useful insight into how different types of users might interact. This is particularly relevant with the inclusion of a visually impaired user profile using this site given they would be relying of different characteristics than the other profiles. Having this in mind whilst creating the HTML and CSS resulted in particular components of the content being better considered in order to make this accessible for many. Beginning this was the inclusion of correctly naming aspects of the code. Through using a nav, button, p, h1, h2 etc. these components will assist screen readers with comprehending how to interpret this site. Ensuring components are like this rather than only using a div, which is difficult for screen readers to translate, further assists accessibility. With also distinctively naming links and using descriptive alt text for images, it further allows screen readers to access this content. Other characteristics which have been included which do not relate to blind users, but to others more commonly impaired with colour blindness. The visuals of this site have been carefully selected so not to confuse or visually disrupt displays. Ensuring that strong contrasts between areas and clearly spaced colours will avoid any form of confusion.</p>

          <p>Through using a range of these attributes to assist impaired users of this website, this has resulted in the design being more accessible to a broader range of end users. This not only is an ethically sensible decision, but it also has the ability to impact perspectives of potential customers. If these individuals were then unable to use this site due to its poor design, they very easily could use an alternative firm. The decision to include these minorities, is at the expense of minimal more effort to produce these outcomes. Moving forward with this decision of creating an accessible website, the inclusion of other features could benefit this site greatly. Having a day-night mode and a scale to adjust font sizes will improve usability. The day-night feature will assist with contrast, and having an adjustable font size will allow users, potentially older ones, to scale up content to more easily view. Both these decisions are minimal to do but provide a massive impact with assisting accessibility for users.</p>

          <p>For the tablet layouts, not a lot really needs to be changed compared to the mobiles below. Most of the content can remain its same sizes, it just becomes a matter of ensuring content is centered for this screen size change. The only area that really needs to be considered is the information at the top of the screen on the reflections page. The concept where the information is condensed into a thinner strip, not only will assist when scrolling (if this is fixed) but it will also mean that the main content below does not become too small given the existing home link to the right taking up important space, particularly when reducing the screen size.</p>

          <p>Wireframe sketches for how this website might appear on a mobile. Both the home and reflections page.</p>
          <p>The main changes to the mobile home page would only be the sizing and positioning of content to make the work fit better, however given the simplistic layout of the home page currently, not much can really be changed. As for the reflections page, more changes would need to be made as the current positioning of the link and the main content would result in this content becoming too small. For all these iterations the information at the top of the page would likely be fixed when scrolling. By doing this, consideration of sizing is crucial as this information could very easily become overpowering and take up too much of the screen. Due to this, the choice of information is important as only a limited amount should be used to take up minimal space.</p>

          <p>Being a distributed version control system for code, Git presents teams of developers the ability to create, demo, and redesign website prototypes a varying stages stress free. This distributed development means that each developer has their own repository where changes can be made without impacting the workflow of others. With a project being saved in a repository, in this folder is a history of every manual change saved (committed) in it. Every time a commit is saved, this represents all of the work up until then from this individual, so if issues arise, content can be cloned and checked with other developers, thus creating risk free development. Added to these commits is the option to include descriptions of what changes have been made. This then creates ease for this individual as well as other developers working on the same project so that shared information and alterations do not get mixed up. One considerably useful aspect of Git is how all these feature branches allows the master code to run live online, while new content is being modified and moved around in another feature branch. Given these changes would be made on one of these branches, these alterations are not visible to users of the website until this content is saved back to the master. Due to these aspects, this offers the ability for groups of developers to confidently and effectively create, demo, and redesign content. Git provides them the ease of mind in knowing that they can iterate and produce multiple alterations before committing to a master.</p>
